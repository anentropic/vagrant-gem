      `vagrant gem` is used to install Vagrant plugins via the RubyGems
      system. In fact, `vagrant gem` is just a frontend to the actual `gem`
      interface, with the difference being that Vagrant sets up a custom
      directory where gems are installed so that they are isolated from your
      system gems.
